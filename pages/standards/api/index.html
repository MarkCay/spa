<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER32ax96skk&t=789s"><i>10 Best Practices For Developing an
      API
      by Peter
      Fisher</i></a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Don't expose database schema in response of your API endpoints by not keeping database field names same as API
    field names</li>
  <li>Don't expose the IDs of the records if you can help it, and keep the IDs random and not in incremental orders,
    so that it is not like 1,2 3. This helps in not allowing someone to know the details of other IDs by querying them
    incrementally</li>
  <li>Try and use HTTPS everywhere, and try and keep everything as encrypted as possible, to keep the user credentials
    and
    other sensitive information as secure as possible.</li>
  <li>Explaining other API endpoints in the API return that you are using, e.g. if the API endpoint is /customer then
    keep
    a section in the response to explain the developer/(user of the API)
    that they can use other endpoints like /customerDetails /customerOrder with the help of the original API response.
  </li>
  <li>API versioning - Keeping versions of the APIs, to keep the old API users still in good shapes and resolve bugs in
    the new APIs version.
    Keeping 2 or more versions of the same API might also be required for some other factors to keep the mobile,
    desktop,
    tablet all running at the same time or maybe some features are on 1st version and others on 2nd version.</li>
  <li>
    HTTP STATUS CODES - Using wrong HTTP status code is not a good practice. Also try to explain the http status code
    meaning in the documentation you have created.
  </li>
  <li>Rate limit and throttling, do this first to keep scaling your API. Rate Limit to some threshold to keep specific
    entity to allow to query only specific number of times in certain period so that it is servable to large pool of
    users
    everytime.
    Rate limit also helps in reducing denial of service attack.</li>
  <li>After API rate limit is reached we have authorization and authentication by using something like OAuth2</li>
  <li>Keep everything consistent by using proper naming convention throwout e.g. calling user as user everywhere and not
    customer in one place and user in other places. Perhaps if need arrise change your thinking to this is a user of
    type
    customer here.</li>
  <li>API clients -> If there are several API clients in different code base but using the same API then keep the single
    API code base for all of them and import that library or inject that as a dependency into their code base.
    So you don't end up copying the API code base in all different clients and keeping them all consistent by changing
    at
    multiple places. You will have only one place to change if you keep it is single code base.
    The testing of the API also becomes easy and isolated and do not rely on the API client by keeping single code base
  </li>
